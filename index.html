                <p> JamBox is a creation of mine that I have done purely for fun. It offers nothing that Spotify or other webscraping sites don't already do. </p>

                <li> <b>Top Songs Over Time: </b> Will show your top most songs for given periods. </li>
    
                <li> <b>Recently Played: </b> Stay up-to-date with your most recent musical adventures. </li>
                    
                <li> <b>Soon coming - classify your taste as a barbie: </b> Don't ask how I am going to do this, but at one point, I will develop this website to analyse your music profile and then classify you as a barbie character.
